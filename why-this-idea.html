        <h2>The Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
            While skiing in Vals, Italy, I encountered a public ski racecourse that allowed anyone with a lift pass to ski around gates and record their performance. Watching my runs online inspired me to think: 
            <strong>What if AI could analyze this data to give real-time coaching?</strong> 
            This idea became OpenSkiAI—a project to make skiing accessible to everyone, regardless of income or background.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Open Source?</h2>
        <p>
            As a solopreneur, I’ve been licensing my music under Creative Commons licenses for many years. I understand the importance of making ideas and tools freely available. 
            By creating OpenSkiAI under an open-source license, I hope to ensure that these basic, common-sense ideas remain free for anyone to use and expand upon—rather than being monopolized by corporations.
        </p>

        <h2>Preventing Innovation Barriers</h2>
        <p>
            In the past, corporations have patented simple concepts—like eBay’s “Make an Offer” button—which stifled innovation and prevented others from building upon them. By keeping OpenSkiAI free, we can democratize skiing and ensure that anyone, anywhere, can enjoy real-time AI coaching without facing financial or technological barriers.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is <strong>Jamison Young</strong>. I grew up in the Snowy Mountains of Australia, and I’ve been passionate about skiing for as long as I can remember. 
            Skiing is often seen as an elite sport, but I believe technology like AI can make it more inclusive. OpenSkiAI is my attempt to bring this vision to life. If you're interested in collaborating, feel free to contact me at <strong>jamisony@gmail.com</strong>.
