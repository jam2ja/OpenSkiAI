    <h1>Open Technologies</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Available Open Technologies</h2>
        <p>
            Technologies like the Microsoft Kinect, LiDAR sensors, and video processing tools offer powerful ways to analyze skiing techniques. These tools are already available to developers and hobbyists, providing a foundation for projects like OpenSkiAI.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Kinect?</h2>
        <p>
            The Microsoft Kinect is a versatile, open-source-friendly tool that has already been widely hacked and used for various purposes. It offers 3D motion capture and depth-sensing capabilities, making it ideal for analyzing skiing posture, turns, and overall form in real-time.
        </p>

        <h2>LiDAR and Video Comparison</h2>
        <p>
            LiDAR technology can create precise 3D maps of skiing environments and track motion with incredible accuracy. Combined with video comparison tools, AI could analyze your skiing style against that of a professional skier. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You could upload a video of a great skier navigating gates.</li>
            <li>Upload your own video of the same course.</li>
            <li>AI would compare the two, identifying differences in speed, technique, and trajectory to provide personalized feedback.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Open-Source Possibilities</h2>
        <p>
            By focusing on open-source solutions, we ensure that these powerful tools remain accessible to everyone. As we've seen with Kinect and other technologies, the open-source community is often the driving force behind innovation, as developers around the world collaborate and share ideas.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Keeping Technology Open</h2>
        <p>
            It’s crucial to prevent corporatization of these technologies. When companies monopolize ideas and tools, they stifle innovation and limit access. By keeping OpenSkiAI open-source, we can ensure that developers and skiers alike benefit from these advancements, paving the way for even more innovative applications.
