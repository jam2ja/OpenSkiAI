# OpenSkiAI: Democratizing Ski Racing with AI

## How It Started
While skiing in Vals, Italy, I encountered a public ski racecourse that allowed anyone with a lift pass to ski around gates and record their performance. Watching my runs online inspired me: What if AI could analyze this data to give real-time coaching? This idea became **OpenSkiAI**â€”a project to make skiing accessible to everyone, regardless of income or background.

## Vision
Ski racing is often seen as an elite sport, limited by high costs and lack of access. **OpenSkiAI** uses AI and LiDAR technology to provide affordable, real-time feedback for skiers worldwide, making ski racing more inclusive.

## Features
- **Real-Time AI Coaching**: Analyze posture, turns, and performance.
- **Privacy-Friendly**: Uses skeletal tracking, not video recordings.
- **Open Source**: Free for anyone to use, adapt, and share.

## Why Open Source?
By documenting and licensing this concept under Creative Commons, we ensure it remains accessible, preventing corporatization and encouraging collaboration.

Join us to make skiing a sport for everyone!
