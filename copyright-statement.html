    <h2>1. Description of the Concept</h2>
    <p>OpenSkiAI is an open-source, AI-driven system designed to provide real-time, personalized feedback on athletic performance with an initial focus on ski racing. The platform captures and analyzes a range of data—from video footage and sensor outputs (accelerometers, gyroscopes, etc.) to Wi-Fi/Bluetooth signals and mobile device metrics—to deliver actionable coaching insights. Its core objectives include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personalized Performance Feedback:</strong> Analyzing biomechanical movements (e.g., timing between ski gates, speed, weight distribution, and ski length) to help athletes improve technique.</li>
      <li><strong>Self-Improving AI Models:</strong> Leveraging continuous data collection to refine predictions and recommendations, ensuring the system evolves with every use.</li>
      <li><strong>Versatility Across Disciplines:</strong> While initially tailored for skiing, the system is designed for application across a range of sports and creative movement disciplines (e.g., snowboarding, running, swimming, gymnastics, dance, and artistic performance).</li>
      <li><strong>Broad AI and Research Applications:</strong> Serving as both a performance analysis tool and a training resource for AI models—benefiting robotics, healthcare (gait analysis, rehabilitation), and machine learning research focused on motion prediction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Technical Foundation</h2>
    <h3>2.1 AI-Based Movement and Biomechanical Analysis</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Data Acquisition:</strong> Utilizes video, sensor inputs, and emerging technologies (such as Wi-Fi/Bluetooth positioning) to capture detailed movement data. Mobile devices, wearables, and IoT sensors can all serve as data sources.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Machine Learning Algorithms:</strong> Trained to recognize biomechanical patterns and compare user performance against professional benchmarks, with key variables including weight, ski length, body distribution, and environmental factors.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>2.2 Self-Improving Through Gate Timing & Speed Tracking</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Timing Analysis:</strong> In ski racing, the AI precisely measures the time between gates (or checkpoints) to learn optimal movement patterns and iteratively improve its feedback.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Adaptability:</strong> This timing methodology extends to other sports, such as stride analysis in running or stroke timing in swimming, ensuring broad applicability.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3 Real-Time Feedback and Environmental Data Integration</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Immediate Guidance:</strong> The system can provide real-time feedback via audio cues, wearable notifications, or AR glasses, allowing athletes to adjust technique on the fly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Environmental and Contextual Data:</strong> Integration of environmental data (temperature, snow conditions, weather) allows for a holistic analysis that factors in external influences on performance.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.4 Data Privacy, Security, and Cloud Scalability</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>User Data Protection:</strong> Emphasizes encryption, anonymization, and user-controlled data storage to protect sensitive biometric and location data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cloud Integration:</strong> Leverages cloud computing for heavy data processing and large-scale deployments, ensuring the system is scalable for both individual and group use.
      </li>
    </ul>
