        <h2>Description of the Concept</h2>
        <p>OpenSkiAI is an open-source concept designed to use artificial intelligence to provide real-time, personalized feedback on athletic performance, initially focusing on skiing. By analyzing video footage, sensor data, or other motion capture methods, OpenSkiAI offers athletes actionable advice to improve their technique.</p>
        <p>In addition to its application in sports, OpenSkiAI also serves as a tool for training and retraining artificial intelligence systems. By leveraging motion data, OpenSkiAI can contribute to advancing AI models designed to interpret, evaluate, and replicate biomechanical movements, benefiting broader fields such as robotics, health sciences, and machine learning research.</p>
        <p>This system is versatile and can be applied to skiing and other sports requiring movement analysis, such as snowboarding, tennis, swimming, gymnastics, golf, and more.</p>

        <h2>Technical Foundation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AI-Based Movement Analysis:</strong> OpenSkiAI employs machine learning algorithms trained on video footage or sensor data to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify biomechanical patterns of motion.</li>
                    <li>Compare user performance against professional or predefined benchmarks.</li>
                    <li>Provide real-time or post-session feedback tailored to the userâ€™s needs.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Customizable Training Models:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The system allows instructors, athletes, or developers to configure AI models based on specific goals, such as improving speed, precision, or efficiency.</li>
                    <li>Users can integrate the system into tailored workflows for sport-specific coaching or AI training.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Broader Applications for AI Development:</strong> OpenSkiAI can also be used as a training dataset generator and retraining tool for AI systems that require understanding human or biomechanical movements. This opens possibilities for robotics, healthcare (e.g., gait analysis or rehabilitation), and machine learning research focused on motion prediction or recognition.</li>
            <li><strong>Open Ecosystem for Collaboration:</strong> OpenSkiAI encourages community-driven innovation by enabling developers, instructors, and researchers to contribute and share improvements freely.</li>
        </ul>
