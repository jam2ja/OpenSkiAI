    <h1>Who’s Creating LiDAR Glasses and Tools?</h1>
    <p>LiDAR technology is transforming industries by capturing precise spatial data for applications like augmented reality, navigation, and sports. Here are some companies and projects actively developing LiDAR-based glasses and tools:</p>
    
    <div class="company">
        <h2>1. Fourier</h2>
        <p>Fourier is developing all-day wearable augmented reality (AR) glasses that integrate LiDAR technology. These glasses aim to add AR capabilities to everyday life, enhancing applications in sports, training, and navigation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="company">
        <h2>2. TriLite Technologies</h2>
        <p>Based in Austria, TriLite Technologies focuses on photonics technologies for smart glasses, including LiDAR integration. Their innovations enhance AR experiences by providing precise imaging capabilities.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="company">
        <h2>3. Rokid</h2>
        <p>Rokid, a Chinese startup, specializes in augmented reality glasses. While their primary focus is AR, their products may incorporate LiDAR technology to improve spatial awareness and interaction in various settings.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="company">
        <h2>4. Apple’s Smart Glasses</h2>
        <p>Apple is rumored to be developing smart glasses that include LiDAR sensors. These glasses aim to integrate augmented reality seamlessly into daily life, potentially offering unique applications for sports and entertainment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="company">
        <h2>5. Meta’s Orion Project</h2>
        <p>Meta (formerly Facebook) is working on advanced smart glasses, codenamed Orion, expected to include LiDAR technology. These glasses aim to blend digital information with the physical world, opening up possibilities for immersive sports analytics.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Why Does This Matter for Skiing?</h2>
    <p>LiDAR glasses and tools can revolutionize skiing by providing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Feedback:</strong> Analyze technique, positioning, and trajectory during runs.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Ownership:</strong> Allow skiers to own and monetize their performance data.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Viewing Experiences:</strong> Provide audiences with immersive visuals and real-time analytics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Open Innovation with OpenSkiAI</h2>
    <p>While companies like Apple and Meta are advancing LiDAR technologies, OpenSkiAI aims to ensure these tools remain accessible to all. By promoting open-source innovation, we can prevent the monopolization of such powerful technologies and empower skiers, instructors, and enthusiasts alike.</p>
