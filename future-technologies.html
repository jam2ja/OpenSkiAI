    <h1>Future Technologies for Ski Racing</h1>
    <p>The future of ski racing lies in harnessing advanced technologies like LiDAR, smart goggles, and open data platforms. These tools can revolutionize how skiers, coaches, and fans engage with the sport while ensuring that users retain ownership and control of their data.</p>
    
    <h2>LiDAR Goggles</h2>
    <p>Imagine a pair of smart goggles equipped with LiDAR sensors, capable of capturing 3D maps of the slopes in real-time. These goggles would allow skiers to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Track their exact position on the course.</li>
        <li>Analyze their turns, speed, and technique with precision.</li>
        <li>Receive real-time feedback through an augmented reality display.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The data captured by these goggles could remain the property of the skier, allowing them to decide how and where to use it.</p>

    <h2>Owning and Selling Data</h2>
    <p>In the current model, hardware creators often own the data generated by their devices. However, in this vision, skiers and professionals would own their data and could:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sell their performance data to TV networks or content platforms.</li>
        <li>Use their data for sponsorships and promotional opportunities.</li>
        <li>Collaborate with researchers or brands to enhance technology and training methods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>LiDAR for Privacy-Friendly Data Collection</h2>
    <p>LiDAR technology is particularly beneficial because it captures spatial and environmental data without infringing on privacy. Unlike cameras, LiDAR does not record identifiable faces or voices, making it a safer option for data sharing and analysis.</p>

    <h2>Applications Beyond Skiing</h2>
    <p>This data could extend beyond skiing into areas like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Insurance: Providing skiing data to customize insurance premiums based on skill and risk levels.</li>
        <li>Coaching: Sharing data with coaches to improve techniques and reduce injuries.</li>
        <li>Safety: Using LiDAR for early detection of hazards on slopes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Encouraging Open Platforms</h2>
    <p>To ensure fairness and inclusivity, this project advocates for open platforms where skiers can control and share their data freely. By keeping technologies like LiDAR and AI open-source, we can prevent monopolization and ensure that innovation benefits everyone, not just corporations.</p>
