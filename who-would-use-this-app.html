    <h1>Who Would Use This App</h1>
    <p>This app is designed to be as <strong>user-friendly</strong> and <strong>open-source</strong> as possible, empowering a wide range of users to configure the application in ways that suit their needs. Whether you’re a ski instructor, an individual skier, or part of a ski resort, this app would adapt to your unique requirements, providing insights and AI-driven analysis.</p>
    
    <h2>Potential Users and Their Use Cases</h2>
    <h3>1. Ski Instructors</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Create customized agents for their classes, allowing students to upload videos of their runs.</li>
        <li>Receive AI-generated analysis of each student’s performance and provide tailored feedback.</li>
        <li>Collaborate with students to track progress and refine techniques.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>2. Individual Skiers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Interact directly with their personal AI agent to analyze their runs.</li>
        <li>Compare performance with professional skiers and receive actionable advice.</li>
        <li>Configure the app independently for personal improvement.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>3. Ski Resorts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Enhance their offerings by integrating the app into public ski racecourses.</li>
        <li>Provide feedback to users about their runs.</li>
        <li>Ensure fair compensation to ski instructors for contributing data to train AI models.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Open Source Matters</h2>
    <p>This app is built on the principle of <strong>open technology</strong> to prevent the monopolization of AI tools by corporations.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ski instructors</strong> should own and benefit from the technology they help train.</li>
        <li><strong>AI agents</strong> should be freely available and customizable, not exploited for profit by corporations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Vision for Fair Collaboration</h2>
    <p>Currently, corporations risk monopolizing AI tools by controlling ski performance data without sharing benefits with instructors or users. This app envisions a fairer model:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Instructors could sell their data to resorts or use AI tools to enhance their services.</li>
        <li>Users and instructors benefit from a mutually beneficial relationship with AI.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why This App Is Unique</h2>
    <p>The goal is to <strong>democratize skiing technology</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Leverages open-source tools like <strong>Microsoft Kinect</strong> and <strong>LiDAR</strong>.</li>
        <li>Provides AI-driven analysis to compare personal performance with professional runs.</li>
        <li>Offers real-time coaching and feedback for all users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why I Built This Idea</h2>
    <p>As someone who isn’t a coder, my vision is to use AI as a collaborative partner, where I can describe the app I want, and AI helps build it. This project reflects my belief in keeping innovation open and accessible, preventing corporations from limiting creativity or progress.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is <strong>Jamison Young</strong>, and I’ve been licensing my music for years, focusing on open-source and Creative Commons principles. I believe that early-stage ideas must remain open to allow for innovation and avoid monopolization. This project reflects my love of skiing, my passion for open technology, and my desire to empower others to build on these tools without restrictions.</p>
